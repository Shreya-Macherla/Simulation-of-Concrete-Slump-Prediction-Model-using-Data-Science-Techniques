# Simulation-of-Concrete-Slump-Prediction-Model-using-Data-Science-Techniques

•	Predicted the slump of concrete using various regression techniques. Involved analysis, pre-processing, and exploration of the data.

•	Evaluated the performance of regression models like Linear, Multilinear, Polynomial, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Elastic net regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest regression based on quantifiable metrics like RMSE and R2.

•	Technologies: Pytorch, TensorFlow, sklearn, Matplotlib, Plotly, RMSE and R2 analysis.
